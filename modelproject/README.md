# Model analysis project

Members: Marius MÃ¼ller, Esben Stein, Simon Rippert

Our project is titled **Ricardian Model of Trade** and is about analising trade flows of two distinct countries.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
