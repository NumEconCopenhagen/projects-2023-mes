This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. 
2. Data project. We fetch data from the German federal statistical office (Statistisches Bundesamt) on Age Distribution per county and Motor Vehicle Distribution per county and show that age might have an affect on distribution of specific motor vehicles.
3. Model project. We model the Ricardian model of trade and solve for the equilibrium in autarky and under trade.
4. Exam project. This contains the notebook and answers for the exam.
