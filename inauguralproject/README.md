# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

**Group Members:** The members of this group are: Marius MÃ¼ller (wkz623), Simon Rippert (gbt919) and Esben Stein (qrt888). 

**Contents:** We use the Household Specialization Model as a basis for our further analysis. By constructing a discrete and continuous solver we examine and illustrate how changes in the baseline parameters affect the variables of interest. Furthermore, we refer to the regression formulation of Siminski and Yetsenga (2022) to analyse and discuss the model fit with regard to the given data.
