# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

**Group Members:** The members of this group are: Marius MÃ¼ller (wkz623), Simon Rippert (gbt919) and Esben Stein (qrt888). 

**Contents:** We used the Household Specilization Problem provided to us as a basis for our computations. By constructing a discrete and continuous functio we looked at how changes in different parameters affected the relative working hours of women when compared to men. Furthermore, we used the given model to reestimate the regression from Siminski and Yetsenga to discuss and analyse the model fit in regards to the given data.
